# Dotfile Configurations

In order to better organize configurations between environments I'll be keeping all of my configurations here in this dotfile repo.

The installation scripts will install all dependencies, edit manually to remove any installation.

Heavily inspired by [@FatBoyXPC](https://github.com/colbycheeze/dotfiles) and [@colbycheeze](https://github.com/colbycheeze/dotfiles) implementations. Uses [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) for dot file linking.

## In constant and infrequent updates.

Most commit messages are created with `git yolo` alias.

This repo is for me but may be useful to others.
